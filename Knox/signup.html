<!--Ah ah ah
    Ah
    I'm the boy in your other phone
    Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
    Pushing 40 in the friend zone
    We talk and then you walk away every day
    Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
    And maybe you're right to doubt me, but
    But if you give me just one night
    You're gonna see me in a new light
    Yeah, if you give me just one night
    To meet you underneath the moonlight
    Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough
    I wanna know the real thing about you
    So I can see you in a new light
    Take a ride up to Malibu
    I just wanna stay to look at you, look at you
    What would it matter if your friends knew?
    Who cares what other people say anyway
    Oh, we can go far from the end
    And make a new world together baby
    'Cause if you give me just one night
    You're gonna see me in a new light
    Yeah, if you give me just one night
    To meet you underneath the moonlight
    Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough
    I wanna know the real thing about you
    So I can see you in a new light
    Ay, ay
    Ay, ay
    Ay, ay
    Ay, ay
    Ay, ay
    Ay, ay
    Ay, ay
    Ah ah ah ah ah
    Yeah, if you give me just one night
    You gonna see me in a new light
    Yeah, if you give me just one night
    To meet you underneath the moonlight
    What do I do with all this?
    What do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you
    What do I do with all this?
    What do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you
    What do I do with all this?
    What do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you
    What do I do with all this?
    What do I do with all this, oh yeah-->
